Mr Kishor - who has guided the Congress, the Trinamool, and the Aam Aadmi Party to wins over the Prime Minister's BJP - repeated his warnings of the past - that the ruling party is not invincible. Less than two weeks before the general election, poll strategist Prashant Kishor sounded a red alert for the Congress and INDIA opposition bloc, warning of improved performances - seats + vote share - by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party across six eastern and southern states. Three of these six states - Bengal, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu - will vote by 2026. \n"
